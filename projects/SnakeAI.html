            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                SnakeAI is an advanced rendition of the classic Snake game, integrating various AI models trained
                through the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Developed using the Pygame library and Python's powerful
                PyTorch for training AI models, SnakeAI demonstrates the intersection of game development and machine
                learning.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple AI models playing simultaneously.</li>
                <li>AI models trainable via Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm.</li>
                <li>Customizable AI models parameters.</li>
                <li>Capabilities to save and load trained AI models.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Pygame</li>
                <li>PyTorch</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setup & Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Clone the repository and install the required dependencies (pygame and torch). Running the game is as
                simple as executing the command <code>python3 snake.py</code>. The game window pops up, and the AI
                models start training and playing the game simultaneously.
            </p>

            <h3>Customization</h3>
            <p>
                SnakeAI offers a wealth of customization options. Adjust AI model parameters like the discount factor
                for future rewards and learning rate in the DQN algorithm. Save and load trained models conveniently.
                Tweak game settings like window size, grid size, epsilon decay, batch size, and replay memory size for a
                tailored experience.
