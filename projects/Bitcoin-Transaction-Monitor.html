            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                The Bitcoin Transaction Monitor is a Python application that listens to real-time Bitcoin transactions.
                Leveraging WebSockets, it subscribes to and logs unconfirmed transactions from the Bitcoin network,
                providing valuable insights into real-time transaction flow.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time tracking of Bitcoin transactions.</li>
                <li>Logs detailed information about each transaction such as transaction ID, timestamps, input and
                    output addresses, and transaction amounts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Websockets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setup & Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Run the Python script and it will start listening for and logging unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions in
                real time. Each transaction's details are displayed as soon as it's received.
            </p>

            <h3>Customization</h3>
            <p>
                The code can be extended to include more data from each transaction, or to perform additional tasks when
                a transaction is received. For instance, it could be extended to store the transactions in a database,
                or trigger alerts based on specific transaction characteristics.
