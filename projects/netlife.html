        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The AI Game Simulator uses a combination of Neural Networks, optimization algorithms, and a custom-built grid-based environment to simulate a dynamic game of cellular growth and interactions. Each cell, governed by a simple neural network, decides its state based on the neighborhood and can breed with others to produce offspring with averaged traits.

    <section id="technical-details">
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            The project is developed in Python, using the following libraries and technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>PyTorch for creating and training the Neural Networks</li>
            <li>Adam optimizer for optimizing the network parameters</li>
            <li>Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface</li>
            <li>Random module for generating initial state and color of cells</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="project-challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Managing the dynamics of a growing cell population and ensuring the performance of the simulation was a challenge. The project required careful design of the neural network and an efficient implementation of the grid and its updating mechanism.

    <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The application successfully simulates a dynamic, evolving cellular environment where cells interact, breed, and change state based on their neighborhood. It provides a fascinating insight into emergent behavior and can be used as a fun educational tool for understanding basic principles of artificial intelligence and game theory.
