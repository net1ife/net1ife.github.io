        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The AI Price Predictor is an application which uses a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
            and
            Bayesian Optimization to predict stock prices. It fetches the historical data, trains the LSTM model,
            optimizes the
            model's hyperparameters and then uses the model to predict the next day's opening, closing, highest, and
            lowest prices.

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            The project is developed in Python, using the following libraries and technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Streamlit for creating the web app</li>
            <li>PyTorch for creating and training the LSTM model</li>
            <li>Bayesian Optimization for optimizing the model's hyperparameters</li>
            <li>Yahoo Finance for fetching the historical data</li>
            <li>Technical Analysis Library in Python (TA-Lib) for calculating technical indicators</li>
            <li>Scikit-learn for preprocessing the data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main challenges was to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the LSTM model.
            To solve this problem, Bayesian Optimization was used, which significantly improved the model's accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge was dealing with noisy stock market data. A solution was to use technical indicators
            calculated by TA-Lib, which smoothed out the noise and improved the model's performance.

    <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The application successfully predicts the next day's opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices of a
            chosen stock.
            However, it's important to note that stock price prediction is inherently uncertain and this tool should be
            used as a
            part of a comprehensive investment strategy.
