            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                Ethereum Contract Fetcher is a Python application that connects to the Ethereum blockchain and fetches
                real-time contract creation data. The application uses the Web3 library to interact with Ethereum's
                mainnet via Infura and logs details of new smart contract creations.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time tracking of Ethereum smart contract creations.</li>
                <li>Logs detailed information about each contract creation such as block number, sender address,
                    contract address, and timestamp.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Web3</li>
                <li>Infura</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setup & Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Replace 'Your-Infura-Project-Id' with your actual Infura Project Id in the Web3 HTTP Provider setup. Run
                the Python script and it will start listening for and logging Ethereum smart contract creations in real
                time. Each contract's details are displayed as soon as it's created.
            </p>

            <h3>Customization</h3>
            <p>
                The code can be extended to include more data from each contract creation, or to perform additional
                tasks when a contract is created. For instance, it could be extended to store the contract creations in
                a database, or trigger alerts based on specific contract characteristics.
