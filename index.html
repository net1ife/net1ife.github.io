            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>

                Hey there! I'm a coder working in Python, AI, and blockchain tech. My journey began with a fascination
                for blockchain and smart contracts, which led me to learning Solidity. Since then, I've been exploring
                Python's versatility across various domains.

                From AI-driven stock price predictions to neural-network simulations and blockchain data fetchers, I've
                taken on diverse challenges.

                I'm always looking to learn and grow, seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving
                coding universe. Crafting clean, efficient, and elegant code is essential to me, evident in my projects.

                I firmly believe technology can revolutionize industries and shape our future. With a passion for all
                things "deep tech," I'm eager to embark on new ventures where I can put my development skills to the
                test and make a meaningful impact.
